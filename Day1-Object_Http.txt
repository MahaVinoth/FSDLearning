1.Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
*************************************

Defenition:

=> HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication. 
=> By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user

HTTP1.1:

=> There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
=> It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages

HTTP2
=>It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
=> It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 

2. Objects and its internal representation in Javascript
*****************************************************

Objects are important data types in javascript. 
 
Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair.

Example: 

let objOfStudent = {
name: 'abc',
id: 123,
std: '5th',
sec: 'A',
contact:1234567890,
class teacher: 'Teacher1'
}

We can create a new JavaScript object using new Object()
let obj1 = person = new Object();


Get the object value use .(dot) operator.
Ex: objOfStudent.id

Objects are mutable: They are addressed by reference, not by value.

JSON is js object notation.
